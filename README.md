# REST APIs
This repo consists of basics related to REST APIs

### What is API?
An API is a program that takes in some data and gives back some other data, usually after processing it.
### Example
Twitter search accepts data, process it and sends data back.
### API consists of three parts
1. User: the person who makes a request
2. Client: the computer that sends the request to the server
3. Server: the computer that responds to the request
### There are four types of actions an API can take:

GET: requests data from a server â€” can be status or specifics (like last_name)
POST: sends changes from the client to the server; think of this as adding information to the server, like making a new entry
PUT: revises or adds to existing information
DELETE: deletes existing information
